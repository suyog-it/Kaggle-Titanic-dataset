# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved competitive accuracy on the validation set.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Trying advanced models
- Improving feature engineering
